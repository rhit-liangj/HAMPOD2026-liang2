--------------------------------------

This document captures the formal requirements for the HAMPOD system, structured in a hierarchical manner suitable for verification and validation:

1. System-Level Requirements (SLR) - Define the overall system purpose, interfaces, and operational environment
2. High-Level Requirements (HLR) - Decompose SLRs into functional and non-functional requirements
3. Low-Level Requirements (LLR) - Specify implementation-level behaviors (to be documented separately)


1.1 Traceability Goals

Every requirement shall:
- Have a unique identifier
- Be traceable to a parent requirement (except SLRs)
- Be verifiable through test, analysis, inspection, or demonstration
- Be unambiguous and testable


1.2 Requirement Notation

Requirements use the following format:
  [ID] The system SHALL/SHOULD/MAY (behavior) WHEN (condition).
       Rationale: (why this requirement exists)
       Parent: (parent requirement ID)
       Verification: Test or Analysis or Inspection or Demonstration


Priority Keywords:
