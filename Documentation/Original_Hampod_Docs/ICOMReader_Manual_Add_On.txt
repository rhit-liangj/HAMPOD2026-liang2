It is worth mentioning that the set mode is really just describing the data entry behavior when normal mode parameters are set on the radio and not just read back. So, all the key mappings of parameters are the same in set mode as they are in normal mode. The only difference is that the set mode is used to set a parameter on the radio and not just read it back. 


1. Audio/Speech Feedback Gaps

list of 6 items
• TODO-1.1: What audio feedback (if any) is given when each digit is pressed? (Beep? Spoken digit? Nothing?)
<A number is spoken if entering frequency or a numeric value for a data parameter (like a value for a "set" item), or the function related for that key is spoken (ex. key 9 says "Notch"). Some keys do not speak anything when doing a query like for frequency or "0" for current mode, or "*" for S meter value. Unfortunately, it just depends on the current state of the HamPod.   
  Also if the key beep option is enabled in the configuration menu, a quick beep is played when the key is initially pressed. If the key continues to be held down, after 0.5 seconds, a second short lower pitch frequency is played letting the user know they have performed a long key press and can then release the key. 
• TODO-1.2: What audio feedback is given when the decimal point [*] is pressed?
< See above but when entering a numeric value like frequency, it says "point".
• TODO-1.3: What audio feedback is given when entry is cleared via [D] or second [*]? (Beep? "Cleared"?)
< [D] says "clear".
• TODO-1.4: What audio feedback is given on keypad timeout?
< When entering a keypad entry, it says"timeout". When no response from the radio, it says "radio timeout".
• TODO-1.5: After frequency is sent to radio, is there confirmation speech? The sequence diagram says "(Optional)" - need definitive answer
< I perform a frequency query as though the user pressed the [1] key which then speaks the frequency for user confirmation  to validate what was expected. 
• TODO-1.6: What audio feedback for invalid frequency entry? (Out of range for radio, malformed, etc.)
< No warning, just a report of the current frequency which will prove the user entered a valid entry or not. 
list end

2. Frequency Format & Validation Gaps

list of 10 items
• TODO-2.1: What is the frequency unit? MHz assumed, but not explicitly stated for entry
< Correct, MHz is expected or start with a "." for a KHz frequency. .
• TODO-2.2: What is the maximum number of digits allowed before the decimal point?
< Not validated but if desired, it would b 4 digits to enter a GHz value. 
• TODO-2.3: What is the maximum number of digits allowed after the decimal point?
< Not explicitly counted but with Icom, 11 digit buffer. See next answer. 
• TODO-2.4: What is the total maximum buffer size for frequency entry?
< In the Icom firmware, it is set to 11 digits. If a 12th digit is entered, it beeps.  ex. 1234.123456 
• TODO-2.5: Are leading zeros allowed/handled? (e.g., 07.000 vs 7.000)
< Leading zero's are ignored but are counted as one of the 11 digits within the input buffer. 
• TODO-2.6: What happens if user presses [#] (ENTER) with NO digits entered?
< In Normal mode, It selects the VFO to work with. ex. "A" -> "B" -> "C" (only for some Kenwoods  or "Current" for Icom)
• TODO-2.7: What happens if user enters only a decimal point and presses ENTER? (e.g., . or 14.)
< "14." [Enter], wil set the radio to 14.000 MHz. 
• TODO-2.8: What happens if user presses [*] BEFORE entering any digits?
< Equivalent to entering a decimal point. If pressed a second time, it says "clear" and aborts the frequency entry function. 
• TODO-2.9: Is there frequency range validation before sending to radio? Or is the radio responsible?
< The radio is responsible but I do some validation like if sending a string of zero's. 
• TODO-2.10: How is an entry of "0" handled? Is it valid?
< It just fills the input buffer with zero's. If you try to send it, nothing happens and the frequency entry is exited. No sending takes place so there is no automatic frequency query response to confirm anything. Maybe an error message would be a good idea here?  
  Also, if you press an invalid key while entering a frequency ("A", "B", "C"), it plays a low frequency error beep and ignores the keypress. If you press [*] to enter a decimal point a 2nd time, it says "Clear" and exits the frequency entry so only a single press of the [*] key is allowed during a frequency entry. 
list end

3. VFO Selection State Gaps

list of 4 items
• TODO-3.1: If user starts with [#] and presses VFO cycle 3 times (back to A), can they still enter frequency? Or does VFO cycling continue indefinitely
until digit pressed?
< It will cycle through the VFO selections until you either enter a frequency or exit with the [D] key or a keypad timeout occurs. 
• TODO-3.2: What is "Current VFO"? Is it whichever VFO was last active on the radio?
< Yes but only for Icom radio's. No other manufacturer that I'm aware of uses "Current" VFO. 
• TODO-3.3: After VFO selection, is there a timeout if no digits are pressed? Or does it wait indefinitely?
< A keypad timeout will occur if enabled in the configuration settings otherwise waits indefinitely. 
• TODO-3.4: Can user press [D] or [*] to cancel during VFO selection (before any digits)?
< only the [D] key will exit. The [*] key will enter a decimal point or if pressed a 2nd time will then exit. 
list end

4. Key Behavior Edge Cases

list of 5 items
• TODO-4.1: What do keys [A], [B], [C] do in Frequency Entry Mode? Ignored? Error beep?
< Play a low frequency error beep and be ignored. 
• TODO-4.2: What does [SHIFT] ([A]) do in Frequency Entry Mode?
< Play a low frequency error beep and be ignored. 
• TODO-4.3: What does [D] Hold do in Frequency Entry Mode?
< All long [Hold] key presses are disabled during frequency entry and the keys function as a regular tapped keypress. 
• TODO-4.4: Can you press [*] multiple times before it counts as "second press"? (e.g., 14.* then [*] again)
The [*] key will enter a decimal point or if pressed a 2nd time will then exit and say "Clear". 
• TODO-4.5: If buffer already has decimal, does pressing [*] immediately clear, or is there any confirmation?
The [*] key will enter a decimal point or if pressed a 2nd time will then exit and say "Clear". 
list end

5. Keypad Timeout Behavior

list of 4 items
• TODO-5.1: Does the timeout timer reset with each keypress?
< Yes. 
• TODO-5.2: What is the exact timeout range? (Manual says 5-30 seconds in config, but which value is used?)
< The allowable range for the user to select is 5 to 30 seconds for the timeout period. 
• TODO-5.3: Does timeout apply during VFO selection phase, or only after digits have been entered?
< The timeout period starts after any key is pressed during a function that requires multiple key presses. 
• TODO-5.4: Is there audio warning before timeout occurs?
< No, it just says "timeout" when it occurs. 
list end

6. Previous VFO Memory Behavior

list of 3 items
• TODO-6.1: Is the "remembered VFO" announcement immediate? (e.g., "A" spoken automatically?)
< Not sure about this question. The only time a temporary frequency is stored is when either the user enters a new frequency, or purposely saves the current frequency to the temporary memory so it can be recalled later.  This is useful when you are listening to a frequency but then want to wander off and look around the band, then easily return to that saved frequency. 
• TODO-6.2: Is remembered VFO stored in EEPROM (persists across power cycles) or RAM only?
< RAM only. 
• TODO-6.3: What is the default VFO on first-ever frequency entry? (A assumed but not stated)
< No default, the input buffer is empty. 
list end

7. Radio Communication Gaps

list of 4 items
• TODO-7.1: What happens if the radio does not acknowledge the frequency command?
< Nothing, it is ignored and no  speech is provided and the radio remains at its current frequency. Again, maybe an error message would be helpful or just read out the current frequency so the user knows something was invalid. But no response is also an indication of an invalid entry so I suppose either works and I opted for silence. 
• TODO-7.2: What happens if the radio is disconnected during frequency entry?
< Nothing until you try to send the frequency to the radio. Then you would get a "Radio Timeout" message and the function would be aborted. In some of my other firmware packages, I do see that the polling response has died so I announce a device disconnection message so that could be an option here.
• TODO-7.3: Is the frequency entry stored in HamPod's "internal memory" immediately on ENTER, or only after radio confirms? (See [SHIFT]+[#] recall feature)
< Only a valid frequency entry is stored. 
• TODO-7.4: What CI-V command format is used to send frequency to the radio?
< Header + 0x05 + 5 bytes frequency data + FB. Sample command: "FE FE 00 E0 05 78 56 34 12 00 FD" (0012,345.678 KHz).". Note: The RPi version of Hampod should be using hamlib to send the CI-V command to the radio.
list end

8. Special Frequencies (777/999)

list of 4 items
• TODO-8.1: For 777: Exactly what product/firmware info is announced? Format?
< Announces the HamPod Firmware version(s). Something like "HamPod Pi Firmware Version Alpha 0.1
• TODO-8.2: For 999: Is there any confirmation prompt before factory reset?
< No. Not sure if this is needed. Implemented on original HamPod because there is no on/off switch to invoke a reset. 
• TODO-8.3: For 999: Does this require a specific VFO to be selected, or works with any?
< Any VFO will work. 
• TODO-8.4: Are there other undocumented special frequencies?
< No. But you could use this technique to enter unique number sequences to perform special functions or options. 
list end

9. Mode Interaction Gaps

list of 3 items
• TODO-9.1: Can Frequency Entry Mode be entered from modes other than Normal Mode?
< No. 
• TODO-9.2: What happens if user is in Config Mode and presses [#]?
< Only [A], [B], [C], and [D] keys are active during Configuration Mode, all others play an error beep. 
• TODO-9.3: During frequency entry, can you switch serial ports with [D] Hold?
< No. Long press of keys are disabled while entering a frequency. 
list end
