Future Work ideas

Simulated Radio for hampod testing (Use an RPi maybe with a small display) to respond appropriatly to hamlib commands to allow testing without a real radio

Speech input system (microphone instead of keypad) (whisper)

Testing with lower performance, lower cost RPi boards (RPi 3B?), reduced RAM

Investigate RPi speaker hat, microphone

A key for switching between devices (radio, antenna rotor, etc.) (maybe the backspace key?)

Add support for many other radios (Icom, Kenwood, Yaesu, Elecraft, etc.)

Add support for connecting to many devices at the same time

Add a system setup mode for adding devices and adding them to the config file using the keypad interface

Add a systematic way to handle key mappings for different devices so that it is easy to add new devices

Add a system for mapping the keypad keys to different layouts by editing a simple file format (so you can pick where 1,2,3 are however you like)

Add support for many other devices (antenna rotors, etc.)

Convert the OS to use a ramdisk for all operations other than configuration file so that power downs can't corrupt the OS
